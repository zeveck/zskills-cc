<!-- ZSKILLS_CODEX_COMPAT_START -->
## Codex Compatibility

This block applies only to the Codex-installed copy of this skill. It is an adapter layer for the original Claude slash-command instructions, not a replacement for the upstream workflow.

Invocation: in Codex, invoke this skill by naming it, for example `run-plan ...`, or by using the original slash command when the user supplied it. Treat `$ARGUMENTS` as the text after the skill name or slash command. Pass only the intended argument tail when one ZSkill calls another.

Tool mapping: if Codex exposes a subagent tool, map Claude `Agent`, `Task`, or subagent dispatch to that tool. Exploration-only work uses an explorer-style agent; implementation work uses a worker-style agent with explicit file/module ownership and instructions not to revert others work; review and devil-advocate work uses a general review agent. If no subagent tool is available, run the subtask inline, clearly label the degraded independence, and do not claim fresh-agent isolation. `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, and `Bash` map to shell reads, `rg`, and command execution; manual `Edit`/`Write` operations map to patch-based edits.

Skill calls: when this skill invokes another ZSkill such as `/run-plan`, `/draft-plan`, `/verify-changes`, or `/commit`, load and follow the selected skill instructions from Codex's available skills. If you must read the file directly, prefer `$PROJECT_ROOT/.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`, then `$HOME/.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`, then legacy `$HOME/.codex/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`. Do not recursively re-enter the same skill unless the workflow explicitly requires it. Preserve `ZSKILLS_PIPELINE_ID` and related tracking environment across skill boundaries.

Tracking: tracking files belong under the main repository root at `.zskills/tracking/`, never under `~/.codex/skills`. Resolve the main root with the original `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` pattern. Keep `.zskills/tracking/` ignored. Do not delete or clear tracking except through an explicit user-requested clear-tracking workflow.

Landing modes: preserve `direct`, `cherry-pick`, and `pr`. Explicit `direct`, `pr`, or `cherry-pick` arguments win and should be stripped before downstream phase parsing. Otherwise read `.codex/zskills-config.json`, then `.claude/zskills-config.json`, then fall back to `cherry-pick`. If both config files exist and disagree on landing or main protection, stop before landing and report the conflict. `locked-main-pr` remains the preset name for PR mode with main protection.

Foreground runner bridge: Claude cron tools (`CronList`, `CronCreate`, `CronDelete`) are not the Codex implementation for `run-plan finish auto`. In Codex, `finish auto` must use a visible foreground parent runner that stays attached to the initiating REPL and launches one fresh `codex exec` child chunk per phase. Prefer `scripts/zskills-runner.sh`, then `$PROJECT_ROOT/.agents/skills/scripts/zskills-runner.sh`, then `$HOME/.agents/skills/scripts/zskills-runner.sh`, then legacy `$HOME/.codex/skills/scripts/zskills-runner.sh`. If the runner is unavailable, execute at most one phase, write the normal report/tracking handoff, and do not claim autonomous completion. Child prompts containing `RUNNER-MANAGED CHUNK` must not invoke the runner again; they execute exactly one incomplete phase and stop after durable plan/report/tracking evidence.

Hook fallback: Claude hooks are not enforced by Codex in this environment. Compensate with inline preflight checks before commits, cherry-picks, PR merge/auto-merge, worktree deletion, or tracking cleanup: inspect status, protect unrelated changes, verify branch/mode, and preserve `.zskills/tracking`.

Helper scripts: generated Codex installs include shared helpers under `.agents/skills/scripts/` for project installs or `$HOME/.agents/skills/scripts/` for user installs. Prefer project-local helpers at `$PROJECT_ROOT/scripts/` when present, otherwise use the installed helper path, with `$HOME/.codex/skills/scripts/` as a legacy fallback. `zskills-runner.sh`, `zskills-gate.sh`, and `zskills-post-run-invariants.sh` are Codex foreground-runner helpers. If a required helper is unavailable, use the explicit fallback instructions in the skill and report the degraded procedural path.

See `~/.codex/skills/ZSKILLS_CODEX_INTEGRATION.md` for the shared adapter contract.
